# Burial Rush Chain of Events

---
1. HQ spawns 2 or more MINERS with one on mining duty, the other on building duty

2. Building duty MINER builds DESIGN SCHOOL
3. DESIGN SCHOOL spawns 3 LANDSCAPERS
4. LANDSCAPERS start collecting dirt from the tile they spawned on until full. 
    - Once landscapers are full, they switch to SEEK MODE (tentative) and will move towards the enemy base if they can see it.
    - In the event that the DRONE carrying the Landscaper gets shot down before the enemy HQ is in sight and the enemy HQ location is unknown, then the landscaper will move in the same direction as the closest remaining drone it can see 
5. MINER builds FULFILLMENT CENTER
6. FULFILLMENT CENTER spawns 3 DRONES
7. DRONES wait 25-30 turns/units of time (Accounting for pollution) for landscapers to fill
8. DRONES move to pick up landscapers
9. DRONES pickup landscapers
    - Possible additional action would be to have a DRONE bring along a miner to build a net gun at the drop zone
10. DRONES move to be adjacent to a tile that is adjacent to enemy HQ
11. If the exact location of the enemy HQ is undetermined then they simply move in the general direction of the enemy HQ until they find it and perform step 10
    - If a DRONE is shot down farther than 35 sensor range from the enemy HQ
12. DRONES drop landscapers onto tiles adjacent to enemy HQ
13. Once Landscapers confirm they are adjacent to the enemy HQ, they enter KILL MODE and start depositing dirt on top of the enemy HQ until the game ends or it gets picked up and moved by a drone
    - In the event of being moved, landscapers will switch back to seek mode and move back to a spot adjacent to the enemy HQ
