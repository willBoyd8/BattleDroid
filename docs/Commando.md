#### Overall Strategy
This strategy makes lots of improvements over Droideka.
 - Handles Economy and Communication Better
 - Attempts to build a lattice to have improved eco
 - Has some better perspectives on walling that tended to be more consistent/stronger than the walls we had built in previous versions
 
 #### HQ Strategy
 The HQ took on a new role in this bot. It handled observation/management of the wall and defensive drone grids.
 
 #### Miners Strategy
 The miners would invest much of their early energy into searching for soup. If they were far enough away from the HQ,
 they would build a refinery to take care of depositing their resources. This bot placed a lot heavier emphasis on production
 of vaporators. They would frequently place tons of vaporators all over the place if they could. They also would occasionally
 produce a Design School, Netgun, or Fulfillment Center. The longer the miner was alive, the more vaporators it would build before
 building other unit types.
 
 #### The Rush Strategy
 Once a drone was spawned, it would see if it should attempt to rush the enemy. This would sometimes be very successful, and sometimes
 it would fail. It was an attempt that ended up winning us several tournament matches
 
 #### Drone Strategy
 After Attempting rushes, the drones would be default patrol around our base. If they saw an enemy, they would attempt to
 kill it by dropping it in water. If they saw that the wall was not full yet, and there was a nearby landscaper they would place that
 landscaper on top of the wall. After the wall was completed, they would still patrol around and attempt to drown enemies
 and help out friendly units that were trapped. Upon receiving a signal from the HQ, they would attempt to surround the HQ so that enemies
 couldn't attack it with drone rushes.
 
 #### Landscaper Strategy
 Landscapers would attempt one of the following two strategies
  - Wall in our HQ to protect against the floods
  - If that was already successful, Create a massive Lattice
  
#### Wall Strategy
Our bot employed the cross wall. This Strategy had a central group that made a 3x3 wall and then after this was completed,
additional units would add on to the corners, and help add on. They would keep themselves far enough above the water that they 
too could contribute to the main 3x3 wall. This meant that the landscaper-wall ratio was approx. 20:8. Using this strategy,
we could get our wall up to around 2000 blocks high and survive to around round 3100 in an optimal game.

#### Lattice Strategy
Landscapers would build an elevated grid that the miners could build on top of. This allowed us to be able to maintain a
much stronger economy and have some great late-game offensive strategy.

#### Ongiong Problems
 - Bugs (I mean, there are always some)
 - Inconsistent performance
