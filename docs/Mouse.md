#### Overall Strategies
- This bot is our initial attempt at building a wall. It is a fairly weak wall, however in the early stages of battlecode,
it was able to hold off against a number of teams and achieve decent rankings. This built a 5x5 wall around itself and attempted
to build it as high as possible
- This bots Landscaper to Wall Segment Ratio was about 1:4

#### HQ Strategies
- Build 2 Miners (one to the south, and one to the north)

#### Miner Strategies
- Build Design Schools to the East and West of the HQ

#### Design School Strategies
- Build Landscapers to their North and South

#### Landscapers Strategies
- Landscapers would prioritize getting a short wall up first. This wall would allow the Design schools
enough time to build more landscapers.
- Due to construction order and economics, Landscapers would tend to spawn only on the East side of the HQ. If the landscapers
detected this and saw that there wasn't a wall being built on the other side, they would move to the other side of the HQ
to build that wall before the water could get in.

#### Ongoing Problems
- Low Ratio
- Only lasted until about round 2700-2800
- It was a bad use of space and resources. There wasn't really much going on outside of getting this process setup
